# Finding a Place for History as Infrastructure

This project should make it possible to refocus my work, learn how to think in public and begin brainstorming new ways of making my professional life accessible and integrated with a larger world. In place of historical work grounded in anxious efforts at completing one relatively private task, my goal over the next several months is to engage more wholeheartedly with the practices of open scholarship in a broader effort at making my work part of a conversation rather than taking comfort in my ability to hide in a library and talk to myself. 
To this end, I've started a [dang twitting thing](www.twitter.com) account and revived a [blog with a regrettable name](http://blogspot.com/flumesandflummery). I'm writing this as I put together my research agenda for the next five years, so I'm still putting togther a sense of the research agenda that I want to pursue going forward, but I can say that the digital tools that I'm developing seem like a clear way of opening up my approach to scholarship.
